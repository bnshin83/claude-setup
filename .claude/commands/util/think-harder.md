# Think Harder

Deep analysis mode for complex problems.

## Usage
```
/util/think-harder [problem]
```

## Purpose
When you need thorough analysis rather than quick answers. Forces systematic thinking through extended reasoning.

## Process

### 1. Problem Decomposition
- What exactly is being asked?
- What are the constraints?
- What are the unknowns?

### 2. Multiple Perspectives
- Consider 3+ different approaches
- Identify tradeoffs of each
- Look for edge cases

### 3. Evidence Gathering
- What information do we have?
- What information do we need?
- What assumptions are we making?

### 4. Synthesis
- Which approach is best given constraints?
- What could go wrong?
- What's the confidence level?

## When to Use
- Architectural decisions
- Debugging complex issues
- Choosing between multiple valid approaches
- Planning multi-step implementations
- Reviewing security-sensitive code

## Output Format
```markdown
## Analysis: [Problem]

### Understanding
[Restate the problem to confirm understanding]

### Approaches Considered

   - Pros: ...
   - Cons: ...

2. **Approach B**: [description]
   - Pros: ...
   - Cons: ...

```

## Tips
- Don't rush to a solution
- Question your first instinct
- Consider what you might be missing
- Sleep on it (metaphorically - revisit after exploring)
